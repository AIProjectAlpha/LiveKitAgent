    "EXPECTED_ANSWERS = {\n",
    "    \"What are Microservices?\": \"Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services that can be deployed independently. These services are typically focused on a specific business function and are loosely coupled with each other.\",\n",
    "    \"What is the difference between Monolithic and Microservices architectures?\": \"Monolithic architecture is a traditional model where all the components of an application are tightly integrated and operate as a single service. In contrast, microservices are small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network, allowing for more flexibility and scalability.\",\n",
    "    \"Explain the concept of RESTful APIs.\": \"REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are web services that follow the principles of REST, using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for communication between the client and server.\",\n",
    "    \"What is the purpose of HTTP status codes?\": \"HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by the server to indicate the result of the HTTP request. They are divided into five categories: 1xx (informational), 2xx (successful), 3xx (redirection), 4xx (client error), and 5xx (server error).\",\n",
    "    \"What is database normalization, and why is it important?\": \"Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a database to minimize redundancy and dependency. It ensures data integrity and reduces the likelihood of anomalies when updating or deleting data.\",\n",
    "    \"What are the different types of databases?\": \"The main types of databases are relational databases (SQL), NoSQL databases, in-memory databases, and graph databases. Relational databases use structured query language (SQL), while NoSQL databases store data in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.\",\n",
    "    \"What is caching, and how does it improve performance?\": \"Caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in a faster storage medium, such as memory. It reduces the time required to fetch data from the primary source (like a database) and improves the overall performance of an application.\",\n",
    "    \"What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?\": \"SQL databases are relational and store data in tables with a fixed schema. They are suitable for structured data and support complex queries. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational and store data in various formats, allowing for more flexibility in terms of schema and data types.\",\n",
    "    \"What is JWT (JSON Web Token), and how is it used in authentication?\": \"JWT is a compact, URL-safe token used for securely transmitting information between parties. It is often used in authentication to verify the identity of a user by embedding claims in the token, such as user roles or permissions.\",\n",
    "    \"What is the importance of load balancing in distributed systems?\": \"Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed. It improves availability, reliability, and scalability in distributed systems.\"\n",
